## Chti JUG Live demo

This is the repository of the code shown at the Chti JUG, Sept 2021. 

It shows some of the features Java 17 users can expect: 

- string blocks
- various ways of creating lists
- stream optimization for `count()`, `skip()` and `limit()`
- list creation from streams with `toList()`
- alternative to `flatMap()` with `mapMulti()`
- records, including serialization
- sealed classes.
